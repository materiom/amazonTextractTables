        "3. Experimental": "3.1. MaterialsGatifloxacin sesquihydrate (GS) was obtained from Emcure Pharmaceuti-cals Ltd., Pune. Sodium alginate (250 cps for a 2% solution at 25 \u000eC) wasa gift sample from Snap Natural and Alginate Products Limited, Ranipet.Water soluble Chitosan (chitosan acetate, 68 cps for a 1% solution at25 \u000eC) was acquired from Indian Sea Foods (Cochin). Calcium chloridewas purchased from Sigma Chemicals, Mumbai. All other chemicals usedwere of reagent grade.",
        "3.2. Methods": "3.2.1. Preparation of surface cross linked ocular filmsOcular films of GS were prepared using film casting method (Sultana et al.2005; Pandit et al. 2003). Polymeric solutions were prepared by dissolvingsodium alginate and chitosan at distinct compositions (Table 1) along with0.4% (w/v) of GS, and glycerin (10% w/w) in doubly distilled water. Drugpolymer solutions were stirred for 12 h and allowed to stand overnight toremove any entrapped air bubbles. Solutions were then poured into glassPetri dishes. Solvent was allowed to evaporate by placing the Petri dishesin an oven (40 \u0006 2 \u000eC). The dried film was carefully removed from thePetri dish and then cutinto oval shaped films with the help of a die(13.2 mm in length and 5.4 mm in width). The films were dipped into0.2 M calcium chloride solution and allowed to cross-link with Ca2\u00fe for5 s. Films were then rinsed with distilled water several times to removeunreacted calcium chloride on surface. Films were dried at 37 \u000eC andstored (24 \u0006 1 \u000eC, 60 \u0006 5% RH).3.2.2. Determination of thickness, weight and tensile strengthThe thickness and weight of the prepared films were measured with a deadweight thickness gauge and an electronic balance, respectively. Films wereleft to swell for 2 h on an agar gel plate prepared by dissolving 2% (w/v)agar in warm simulated tear fluid (STF \u2013 composition sodium chloride:0.670 g, sodium bicarbonate: 0.200 g, calcium chloride. 2H2O: 0.008 g,and purified water q.s. 100 g) of pH 7.2 under stirring and then pouringthe solution into the petri dish until gelling at room temperature. SurfacepH was measured by means of pH paper placed on the surface of swollenfilms (Mishra and Gilhotra 2008).Film strips (50\u0002 10 mm) were evaluated for tensile strength and elonga-tion at break by modifying the method used by Dandagi et al. (2004). Theapparatus consisted of a base plate with a pulley aligned on it. The filmwas fixed in a film holder at one end of the base plate and the other endTable 4: Values of various parameters obtained from fit of release data to different kinetic models for films prepared before andafter cross-linkingFormulationNon-cross linked filmsCross linked filmsHiguchi modelZero order modelHiguchi modelZero order modelr0.9510.9700.9900.944n0.870.990.890.87Rk0.9650.9640.9850.979\u00000.9816\u00003.15960.1643\u00002.6643r0.9030.8820.9660.942n0.420.440.470.44Rk0.8330.8840.9040.7841.11300.84120.84221.0120Pharmazie 63 (2008) 8F1F2F3F4578ORIGINAL ARTICLESwas fixed with forceps having a triangular end to keep the film straightduring stretching. A thread was tied to the triangular end and passed overthe pulley, to which a small pan was attached to hold weights. A smallpointer was attached to the thread that travels over the graph paper affixedon the base plate. The weights were gradually added to the pan until thefilm was broken. The weight necessary to break the film was noted asbreak force and the simultaneous distance traveled by the pointer on thegraph paper indicated the elongation at break:Tensile strength (g/mm2) \u00bc break force (g)/cross-sectional area of the sample (mm2)Elongation at break (%) \u00bc increase in length at break point (mm)/original length (mm) X 100(1)(2)3.3. Drug content uniformityUniformity of the drug content was determined by assaying the individualinserts. Each insert was grounded in a glass pestle mortar and 5 ml of STF(pH 7.2) was added to make a suspension. The suspension so obtainedwas filtered and the filtrate was assayed spectrophotometrically at 292 nm(UV-VIS Systronics Spectrophotometer-106).3.4. Swelling indexTo determine the swelling index of prepared films, initial weight of filmwas taken, and then it was placed in an agar gel plate (2% w/v agar inSTF, pH 7.2) and incubated at 37 \u0006 1 \u000eC. For 5 h, film was removed fromplate after every hour, surface water was removed with the help of filterpaper, and the film was reweighed. The swelling index was calculated asfollows (Wan et al. 1995).Swelling Index (Sw) % \u00bc [wt \u0000 w0/wo] \u0002 100(3)(Sw) % \u00bc equilibrium percent swelling, wt \u00bc weight of swollen film aftertime t, w0 \u00bc original weight of film at zero time.3.5. Bioadhesive strengthGoat conjunctival membrane was used for the measurement of bioadhesivestrength. The membrane was placed in an aerated saline at 4 \u000eC, whichwas later washed with distilled water and STF (pH 7.2, 37 \u000eC) before use.Bioadhesive strength of the film (n \u00bc 3) was measured on a modified phy-sical balance (Sultana et al. 2006). Membrane was tied to open mouth of aglass vial filled with STF. The vial was fitted in the center of a glassbeaker filled with STF (pH 7.2, 37 \u0006 1 \u000eC). Separately, film was adheredto the lower side of a rubber stopper, which was attached to lever of physi-cal balance. The mass (put on other limb of balance) required to detachthe patch from the conjunctival surface was regarded as bioadhesivestrength. Force of adhesion was calculated:Force of adhesion (N) \u00bc (Bioadhesive strength \u0002 9.81)/1000(4)3.6. In vitro drug release studiesIn vitro drug release study was carried out by using the biochemical donor-receptor compartment model (Sreenivas et al. 2006). A commercial semi-permeable cellophane membrane, presoaked overnight in the freshly pre-pared dissolution medium (STF pH 7.2), was tied to one end of a cylinder(open at both the sides), which acted as donor compartment. The ocularinsert was placed inside the donor compartment in contact with the semi-permeable membrane. The donor compartment was attached to a stand andsuspended in 25 ml of the dissolution medium maintained at 37 \u0006 1 \u000eC soas to touch the receptor medium surface. The dissolution medium wasstirred at a low speed using magnetic stirrer. The aliquots of 5 ml werewithdrawn at regular intervals and replaced by an equal volume of dissolu-tion medium. The samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically at292 nm.Acknowledgements: Authors are grateful to Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,Pune, India for providing the gift samples of gatifloxacin sesquihydrateand Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Jambheshwar Universityof Science and Technology, Hisar, India for providing the necessary re-search facilities.ReferencesDandagi PM, Manvi FV, Patil MB, Mastiholimath VS, Rathod R (2004)Development and evaluation of ocular films of cromolyn sodium.
