        "Results": "3.1.Fabrication of matrix and bio-compositeThe matrix and bio-composites fabrication process yieldeduniform samples without any visible voids or cavities in themacro-scale. Fig. 4 is a representative DIC image showing agood uniformity of this speci\ufb01c sample. While several sampleswere subjected to DIC testing to ensure the repeatability ofmaterial, no rigorous optimization of the fabrication processwas conducted. Thus some of the above defects may becontained in our samples. The Calcium ions diffused into thedialysis membrane, creating uniform hydrogel with controlledgeometry which enabled tensile testing of the hydrogels. Thehydrogel width was 15.7372.53 mm, the gage length was23.5672.06 mm and thickness of 1.4970.66 mm. The bio-composite resulted in encapsulated pre-determined \ufb01berarrangement of the collagen \ufb01bers embedded in a soft alginatehydrogel (Fig. 2f\u2013h). The hydrogel matrix provided aqueoussurroundings for the collagen \ufb01bers, preventing their dehydra-tion during tensile measurements. The composites featuredwidth of 10.1773.95 mm, gage length of 19.7274.71 mm andthickness of 0.8470.37 mm (n\u00bc36). Fiber fraction was rangedbetween 0.05\u20130.59. Fiber orientation measurements are pre-sented in Fig. 3(e) by FFT measurements, con\ufb01rming that themain direction of the \ufb01bers is 00 with the vertical axis.Fig. 4 \u2013 Representative image of Bio-composite lineardisplacement \ufb01eld at applied remote at 5% tensile strain.The uniform linear displacement \ufb01eld of the bio-compositewas determined using the DIC (digital image correlation)method.Digital image correlation (DIC) measurements of bio-3.2.compositeThe mechanical integrity of the bio-composite was examinedand in order to rule out slipping between the \ufb01bers and thematrix, DIC technique was applied during the tensile mea-surements. Fig. 4 exhibits representative image of lineardisplacement \ufb01eld revealed on the surface ofthe bio-composite during a tensile test. The measurements main-tained for three repeated tensile loading cycles and up to 10%strain level. This \ufb01nding indicates a spatial uniformity of themechanical properties within the bio-composite and itshomogeneity and integrity.3.3.Mechanical behavior of the bio-compositeThe bio-composites demonstrated a hyperelastic behaviorwith large deformations. The non-linear stress\u2013strain beha-vior is characterized with relatively low stress response at thebeginning of the loading, followed by increased stiffness(Figs. 7 and 8). Longitudinal bio-composites are characterizedby full range hyperelasticity, when \ufb01ber fraction increasedless damage is caused to the matrix (Fig. 7). However,transverse samples which are matrix dominated are moresubjected to damage. Hence, hyperelastic behavior is observedup to 10% strain (Fig. 8).All mechanical properties are presented for true stress\u2013strains. Failure properties are described in Fig. 5, all the bio-composites demonstrated higher strength than the matrix(0.0870.04 MPa at 0.1870.06 strain). Longitudinal compositesdemonstrated higher strength than transverse compositesfor all tested \ufb01ber fractions. The ultimate strength of bio-composites was changed between the different \ufb01ber frac-tions, the higher the fraction, the larger the tensile strengthfor longitudinal and transverse samples (for longitudinal:Vf\u00bc0.14\u00000.5070.29 MPa at 0.1870.04 strain (n\u00bc4),forVf\u00bc0.21\u00000.6970.18 MPa at 0.1970.04 strain (n\u00bc5) and forVf\u00bc0.30\u00001.2170.29 MPa at 0.2070.03 (n\u00bc3) strain, for trans-verse composites with Vf\u00bc0.07\u00000.1170.06 MPa at 0.1770.04strain (n\u00bc6) and Vf\u00bc0.22\u00000.2670.09 MPa at 0.1970.03 strain(n\u00bc6), as presented in Fig. 5). Differences in the failure strainswere not signi\ufb01cant between the groups or matrix.In order to simplify the hyperelastic stress\u2013strain behaviorand to calculate the stiffness, the non-linear relation can beidealized as bilinear with two slopes, i.e., toe region andlinear region as known for other soft tissues (Holzapfel, 2001).Tangential stiffness was calculated separately for the toe andlinear region as described in Fig. 6(a). First derivative ofstress\u2013strain curves was calculated and the tangential stiff-ness was recorded at strain levels of 3% and 9%, respectively.The second derivative of the region after the toe region (from5% to 10%) is approximately constant, Thus, allow to de\ufb01nethe second stiffness (9% strain) as linear region. The stiffnessof the composites as a function of the \ufb01ber volume fraction inthe toe region and linear region is presented in Fig. 5(c and d).The linear region was signi\ufb01cantly stiffer than the toe regionfor longitudinal bio-composites with Vf40.2. Longitudinalbio-composites were signi\ufb01cantly stiffer from the matrix inthe linear region (ANOVA,po0.001).

(3)) theeffective properties of equivalent \ufb01ber (Vf\u00bc100%) as theaverage of 12 different composites (Vf\u00bc2575.6, n\u00bc6 andVf\u00bc5075.1%, n\u00bc6). The predictive coef\ufb01cients values inTable 1 were calculated using the limit cases of matrix(Vf\u00bc0%) and equivalent \ufb01ber (Vf\u00bc100%). The hyperelasticmechanical behavior up to 10% strain and the limit casesare presented in Fig. 7(a). Additional \ufb01ber fractions can becalculated using the model. The prediction of the proposedmodel for the veri\ufb01cation cases of Vf\u00bc25% and Vf\u00bc50%showed good correlation with the correspond experimentalresults (Table 1).Validation set was fabricated to test the model up tofailure in additional \ufb01ber fractions, Fig. 7(b) demonstratesthe model compatibility to the experimental results.In order to de\ufb01ne the stiffening effect on different \ufb01berfractions, the elasticity modulus was calculated separately forthe toe and linear regions (as described above) as a function ofthe \ufb01ber volume fraction, stiffness was calculated for all long-itudinal samples (calibration and validation sets). Fig. 6(b and c)compares the predictive and experimental stiffness, the differ-ences between the model and experiments were not signi\ufb01cant.Thus, the model can give good approximation for the long-itudinal bio-composites in varied \ufb01ber fractions.4.",
        "Discussion": "In the current study, a novel and natural bio-composite basedon collagen \ufb01bers reinforced alginate hydrogel was designed,fabricated (Fig. 2) and mechanically tested in longitudinaland transverse modes. The effective mechanical behavior ofthe bio-composite is non-linear and hyperelastic, similar tonative soft tissues (Fung, 1967). Bio-composites were con-structed with varied fractions of collagen \ufb01bers, all alignedunidirectional and veri\ufb01ed by FFT \ufb01lter (Fig. 3e). DIC measure-ments presented linear displacement \ufb01eld (Fig. 4), verifyingthe binding between the \ufb01bers and the matrix and indicatinga uniform composite material system.

Validationset included three groups with different fractions: Vf\u00bc0.14(n\u00bc4), Vf\u00bc0.21 (n\u00bc5),Vf\u00bc0.30 (n\u00bc3).adhesion between the matrix and \ufb01bers is covalent bindingbased on the carbodiimide chemistry applied during thepreparation of the bio-composite and/or to non-covalentinteractions as ionic and Van-der Waals interactions sinceboth charged molecules are involved.Mechanical properties of isolated \ufb01bers are larger in anorder of magnitude than connective tissues. However, thelongitudinal bio-composite demonstrated 1\u20132 orders of mag-nitude less in stiffness (2\u201313 MPa) and strength (0.4\u20131.5 MPa),j o u r n a l o f t h e m e c h a n i c a l b e h a v i o r o f b i o m e d i c a l m a t e r i a l s 3 6 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 7 1 \u2013 8 179The coral \ufb01bers, as native collagen \ufb01bers, are micro-crimped(coiled) \ufb01bers (Fig. 1d) that forming tissue-like structure whenembedded in a matrix. This new feature is unique in biomater-ials and allows tissue contraction (Fleischer et al., 2013) and canfacilitate load-shielding of embedded cells by sliding betweenthese three dimensional coiled \ufb01bers (Thorpe et al., 2013).Dedicated technologies have developed for creating this kind ofwaved or \"spring like\" \ufb01bers which are essential for soft tissuesmimicking (Caves et al., 2010c; Fleischer et al., 2013). Thesesynthetic wavy \ufb01bers were embedded in elastin matrix (Caveset al., 2010c). The waviness increased the maximum deformationand reduced the stiffness. Their ultimate strength was similar toour results (1\u20132 MPa). However, Collagen SEM images (Fig. 1c andd) imply on higher order of crimping in our coral collagen (3D),which is a challenging task to achieve synthetically.Fiber reinforced bio-composites are developed for variedbiomedical applications (Caves et al., 2010a, 2011; Kumaret al., 2013; Pok et al., 2013; Thorvaldsson et al., 2013;Wright et al., 2012) most of them were tested for compressionloads and little is known about tailoring their mechanicalproperties. The in\ufb02uence of different \ufb01ber fractions andorientations were examined on the composite material;increasing \ufb01ber fraction and reducing the angle to the loadingdirection have strengthened the composite (Caves et al.,2011). However, we did not found any reference for bio-engineered composite with the ability to computationallypredict the mechanical behavior, and hence to tailor thematerial by tissue needs.The experimental strength ofBoth the matrix and the collagen composite revealedhyperelastic behavior and were modeled by Mooney\u2013Rivlinhyperelastic energy potentials. The predicted results fromthis simpli\ufb01ed nonlinear uniaxial model, allowed examiningthe behavior of bio-composites with additional \ufb01ber fractions.We calculated a Young modulus from the linear region ofthe stress\u2013strain curve after the toe region (as reviewed byMcKee et al. (2011)) and often used to characterize hyper-elastic soft tissues. Therefore these values can be comparedto the current bio-composite. The measured stiffness valuesfraction range (3.2471.12 MPa andin the 14\u201321% \ufb01ber4.5671.14 MPa, respectively) within the linear region, matchnative tissues as sclera (\u00182.0 MPa), cornea (\u00182.7 MPa), arteryand veins (\u00183.0 MPa) (McKee et al., 2011).the longitudinal bio-composite in Vf\u00bc29% (1.2170.29 MPa) is compatible with theAdventitia layer of coronary artery 1.470.6 and 1.370.7 MPafor the circumferential and longitudinal directions, respec-tively (Holzapfel et al., 2005). Fiber fraction of 0.14 and 0.21(0.570.29 MPa and 0.6970.18 MPa, respectively) is compatiblewith soft issues as aorta (0.3\u20130.8 MPa) (Holzapfel, 2001). Higher\ufb01ber fractions (as 70%) can be compatible with other softtissues such as cornea with tensile strength of 3.3\u20134.4 MPa(Zeng et al., 2001). Although these tissues are composed ofmuch complex structures and multidirectional orientations,the uniaxial bio-composite results can give good starting pointfor engineering a speci\ufb01c tissue using a unidirectional laminain a multi-layer and multi-axial laminate. The axial orienta-tion provides the upper bound of strength and stiffness, since\ufb01bers are in the loading direction.The ability to predict the behavior of the composite andcontrol its properties allows tailor design mechanical propertiesFig. 8 \u2013 Mechanical behavior of transverse bio-compositesfor \ufb01ber fractions of 0.07 (n\u00bc6) and 0.22 (n\u00bc6).depends on the volume fraction, than the isolated coral \ufb01bers(0.34\u20130.54 GPa and 39\u201359 MPa, respectively). The stiffness andstrength of the matrix and \ufb01bers differ in about three ordersof magnitude, 0.6 MPa and 0.08 MPa, respectively. This allowsfor a wider degree of freedom for designing and manufactur-ing the bio-composite for pre-speci\ufb01ed elastic properties.The equivalent \ufb01ber properties are lower than the actual\ufb01ber due to the cross-sectional area which is different for theequivalent and \"real\" \ufb01ber.When stretching the bio-composites' in the \ufb01bers direction(longitudinal) strength was larger than in the transverse directiondue to the load that the collagen \ufb01bers bear. The differences instiffness were signi\ufb01cant in the linear region, but not in the toeregion, where all samples are matrix dominated. In higherstrains, the distribution of results is wider, since matrix exhibitsdamage behavior and the composite exhibits a strong stiffnessreduction. The mechanical damage behavior cannot be predictedby the simpli\ufb01ed model.The non-linear stress\u2013strain behavior can be considered asa combination of two linear curves of the toe and linearregions. Suggested explanation for the longitudinal compo-sites for this behavior lies in the structure\u2013function relation;the toe regions' low stiffness can be attributed to straighten-ing the collagen \ufb01ber micro-crimping (Fig. 1c and d), in thisstage of the tensile behavior of the collagen \ufb01bers remainloose and unable to contribute notably to the overall perfor-mance. Thus, the reaction is matrix dominated. However, inthe linear region the signi\ufb01cantly higher stiffness is asso-ciated with stretching of the straight \ufb01bers (Fratzl et al., 1997;Holzapfel, 2001), where the \ufb01bers carry load and dominatethe mechanical reaction. This behavior is characteristic ofsoft tissues due to the presence of collagen (Holzapfel, 2001).In the transverse composites, when the load is not in the\ufb01bers direction, the entire behavior is matrix dominated andthe composites exhibited matrix damage.The novel collagen bio-composite when subjected to axialload demonstrated signi\ufb01cantly stiffer and stronger behaviorcompared to the matrix alone material (Figs. 5 and 7). Moreover,increasing \ufb01ber fraction resulted in proportional stiffening. This\ufb01nding supports our use of parallel spring analogy for nonlinearmechanical constitutive model. Thus the volume fractions alongwith aligned orientation to the loading direction have greaterin\ufb02uence on the overall material response. In the toe region,since the stress is low, the \ufb01ber fraction has relatively lowin\ufb02uence compared to the linear region (Fig. 5c and d).80j o u r n a l o f t h e m e c h a n i c a l b e h a v i o r o f b i o m e d i c a l m a t e r i a l s 3 6 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 7 1 \u2013 8 1based on the mechanical requirements of the natural tissues.Moreover, the ability to control and predict the density anddistribution of the \ufb01bers may allow tailored design of morecomplex tissues which consist of regional changes in sub-areasof the tissues that resulted in regional changes in the mechan-ical properties, such as the stiffness changes with depth in themeniscus and cartilage (Lai and Levenston, 2010) or in theannulus \ufb01brosus (Fujita et al., 1997). Orienting the laminates ofaxis from the loading direction will reduce the strength andallow fabrication of composite with compatible strength variedtissues as annulus \ufb01brosus 0.3070.16(Ebara et al., 1996), andurinary bladder 0.2770.14 MPa (Dahms et al., 1998). Future workwill engage in the mechanical behavior of oriented laminates,their composition and modeling in order to allow tailor-designed fabrication of speci\ufb01c complex tissue structure.5.",
        "Limitations": "The mechanical tests were performed under strain ratesbetween 1 and 3 mm per minute assuming a static responseof the material in this range. Therefore, the in\ufb02uence of thestrain rate on the results was neglected. Collagen \ufb01bers arebiological entities and thus contain some material variability.The latter emanates from non-uniform FVF distributionswithin the material, voids and other matrix\u2013\ufb01ber bonding-cohesive and interphase properties. The current manualfabrication process has an additional effect on the distribu-tions of the tested properties. The material behavior for the\ufb01ber and matrix constituents was assumed to be isotropicand hyperelastic since the current study is mainly concernedand limited to uniaxial loading. While the applied nonlinearrule of mixtures cannot be fully characterized as multi-axialand general material model, it offers a limited predictivemodel for the effective nonlinear axial response of thecomposite material when given the volume fractions andthe nonlinear axial laws of the \ufb01ber and matrix. Finally, theanalysis of the results and the proposed modeling approachdid not take into account the damage response exhibited bythe matrix for strain levels beyond 10%.6.",
        "Conclusions": "A new bio-composite material system is proposed, fabricatedand mechanically investigated. It is based on long collagen\ufb01bers reinforcing an alginate hydrogel matrix. The bio-composite has hyperelastic behavior and can be tailored toyield mechanical properties similar to native tissues. Themicro-structure ofthe \ufb01bers has unique nested coiledarrangement, at both the individual \ufb01ber and the bundlelevels, which can explain its hyperelastic response. A newsimpli\ufb01ed nonlinear micromechanical material model is for-mulated for the bio-composite in its axial loading mode inorder to predict the overall stress\u2013strain relation from thein situ response of the \ufb01ber and matrix constituents. Theprediction of the model has been veri\ufb01ed against tested bio-composites with different \ufb01ber volume ratios.r e f e r e n c e sBenayahu, Y., Benayahu, D., Kashman, Y., Rudi, A., Lanir, Y., Sela, I.,Raz, E., 2011.
